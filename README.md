# Pandas_Challenge

Pandas can do:

DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing.
Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different file formats.
Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
Reshaping and pivoting of data sets.
Label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets.
Data structure column insertion and deletion.
Group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.
Data set merging and joining.
Hierarchical axis indexing to work with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure.
Time series-functionality: Date range generation[4] and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging.
Provides data filtration.
